The data underlying the GTAP-AEZ database is enormous and
complex. This vignette describes the processing of the data on land
use and land cover. The objective is to transform the original data
delivered as rasters into R dataframes. Such transformation makes
feasible including the data in gtapshape and speeds up calculations.

The functions below operate over data stored in folder named
raw-data. The raw-data is in a large zipped archive that can be
downloaded from the GTAP servers. Downloading these data takes
time. The zipped file is 8GB and unzipped it occupies around 32GB.
